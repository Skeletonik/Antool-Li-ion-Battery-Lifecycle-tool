NMC vs LFP battery lifecycle GHG emissions estimation based on a Excel spreadsheet battery degradation model

See the Documentation PDF for more information on the tool and how to work with it. It is fairly simple.

Batteries, mostly lithium-ion batteries, are a critical component of the current energy transition towards global net zero. As such, their usage needs to be carefully considered from multiple perspectives. Otherwise, they could cause more harm than good. Similarly, different types of lithium-ion batteries may be better suited for different kinds of applications as their performance or sustainability specifications may vary widely.

Developed in summer 2021 as part of FUSE UROP project at Imperial College of London under the Faraday Institution within its MSM group.
